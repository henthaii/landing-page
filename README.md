# landing-page
Project: Landing Page for Odin Project. I finished this in 4+ hours, give or take. I feel like my understanding of CSS has gotten stronger now that I got to apply alot of the previous concepts and doing them on my own.

Having alot of references helped my understanding of how to do this project as well. I had to learn how to use some additional CSS properties such as border-radius and aspect ratio (although I'm not sure if it did anything).

Overall, I enjoyed being able to apply the lessons I've been learning since I'm more of a kinesthetic learner. I think my page could use some adjustments to match the reference picture more but I would rather submit my project with only my own work.
